# Text-Mining

Text is everywhere in the form of openions, complaints, news and information; each of us are contributing in generating this text throughout the internet. This large amount of text which is present in the unstructured format can be used for welfare of the society and businesses by analysing the sentiments and trends. A part of NLP deals with Text processing and analysis. Commonly available text can not be directly used for analysis, it needs to pre-processed first, and that is where NLTK, the most popular library for text processing in Python, comes into the picture.

In this notebook, I am going to perform Sentiment Analysis on tweets on any desired topic. Instead of fetching tweets from and CSV I am going to scrap these tweets from the internet.
